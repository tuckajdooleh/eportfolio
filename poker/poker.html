      <p>
        When quarantine started because of COVID-19 my friends and I all wanted
        to play online Texas Hold'em Poker. However as we searched for a good
        website, we learned that every website out there either made you sign up
        and endure hundreds of ads, or made you download their program and also
        sign up and endure ads. So I figured it would'nt be too hard to make my
        own poker website. ( I was wrong )
      </p>
      <p>
        I used node JS, Socket IO, and HTML/CSS/JS for the entire project. I
        used bootstrap just for the room creation page. I made a room system
        where friends could name their own group room and send the link to
        everyone who wants to join. I got the cards from OpenGameArt.com ( They
        were CC but I will credit the creators soon ).
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the second or third iteration of this project, and might not be
        the final iteration. I initially got an idea from
        <a href="http://playingcards.io/">http://playingcards.io/</a> where they
        trust the users to just drag cards around and follow all the game logic
        rules on their own. So I made a program where it would spit out a
        randomized deck in one slot with several empty slots for the users to
        manually drag around. Once I finished I play tested it with friends and
        found that it was not very fun.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then I began working on this version where all the game logic is
        programmed in and makes the entire process much smoother for users. I
        still have more work to do on this, but for now I am too bored of
        working on it so I have temporarily moved on to other projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        It works fairly well. I still need to fix the issue where if the first
        player checks, and another player raises, it will cycle back too many
        times to make sure all players had a chance to call.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another issue is room deletion, and random crashes. I assume the random
        crashes are from Heroku, but I could have just made a huge mistake
        somewhere. Room deletion isn't a huge issue because Heroku restarts my
        server all the time so the rooms get deleted anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also used custom CSS for the game page, but this has lead to the game
        page not looking right on Safari.
