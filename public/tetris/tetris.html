      <p>
        I love playing Tetris, so I decided to program it for fun. I decided to
        use HTML/JavaScript just so I could play it in the browser. For some
        reason I decided to not use the Canvas element. Everything in this uses
        divs and css to display the game. I also use setTimeout for the delays.
      </p>
      <p>
        The board is just a 2d array. I have a shape class, and an array of all
        the differently used shapes. Which one could easily add their own shapes
        if they wish. The shape class has an array of points which create the
        shape. It also has a pivot property which is used to rotate the shape. I
        use the rotate a point about a point equation to rotate all of the
        points in a shape about that shapes pivot point. I also programmed in
        shadows, so the shape class also has a generate shadow function which
        makes a temporary copy of the shape and moves it down until it hits
        something, then just renders a greyed out shape there. I also programmed
        in hard/fast drop, which does the same thing as the shadow function
        where it just moved down until it collides with something. I also
        programmed in the classic tetris random selection method. This method
        generates a bag of all the shapes randomly, and when all of those shapes
        have been used, it generates a new shape. There is also a score counter
        which prioritizes tetrises and increases the speed as you play.
        Programming in the clear line feature was tricky but fun. Everytime a
        block has been dropped it loops through the points of the shape, and
        checks the full row for each point ( not repeating points in the same
        row ), and it checks to see if that row is full, if it is, then it is
        deleted, and all rows above it are shifted down by 1.

        Also upon request from my friends, I have added mobile swiping controls.
