        <h3>Impact</h3>

      <br />
      <p>
        The goal of this website was to create a member tracking system for one
        of our group memebers church leader. The leader wanted this website to
        be open on Ipads for students to sign into worship nights. He then could
        use the admin feature to look at everyones attendance or email
        information.
      </p>

      <p>
        I worked with 3 other classmates to complete this website for our final
        project for our Principles of Software Engineering class. I used PHP,
        HTML/JS/CSS and Bootstrap to write the front end, and backend for
        several pages. The first 3 pictures shown are pages that I worked on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since this was a Software Engineering class, we followed several Project
        Managment, or Software design principles. We interviewed our group
        members church leader to figure out exactly what his needs were. We then
        made front end and backend designs for our project. We also followed the
        Agile development process as we worked on the website.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wrote the server side logic for the login page. I made sure to follow
        proper security practices, making sure to hash the passwords and
        sanitizing the input client side and server side.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also wrote the forgot password page. This page lets you enter your
        email, then it sends you a new password. This page could have been
        improved. There could be issues with someone else constantly reseting
        your password.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also wrote the code for all edit/delete pages. The image provided is
        the search/edit members page. I used php data tables to show all the
        members, then I added an edit / delete button. The edit button takes you
        to an edit page that I also wrote. This code was recycled for several
        other pages.
